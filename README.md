# HEY ANDY

This code is pretty awful so sorry if it is hard to follow. I am just trying to get it done quickly so we can write our paper.

### Things we have left to do
- ~~Implement FIFO~~
- ~~Implement SJF~~
- ~~Implement Round Robbin~~
- ~~Create Graphs for FIFO~~
- ~~Create Graphs for SJF~~
- ~~Create Graphs for Round Robbin~~
- ~~Implement threaded FIFO test~~
- ~~Implement threaded SJF test~~
- ~~Implement threaded Round Robbing test~~
- Probably set it up to ask the user if they want to export all of the CSV files we used to generate our graphs.

> The threaded tests should be fairly easy. I was wondering if we would even need to create threads at all? I think we could just split the original set of processes into 4 different sets and run each individually and then average together the averages of the wait times. Does that make sense? 

> I think there is an error with the FIFO tests. Of course that schduler is written the worst of them all so it will proably take me a while to look though it for errors.

> By the way if you have any objections to running the threaded tests this way please discuss with me. I am not sure if this is cheating or not but I think this is probably the easiest way to simulate it.


**Let me know if I am doing anything blatantly wrong.**
